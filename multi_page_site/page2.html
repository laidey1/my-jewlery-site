    <h4>
         Lynea's Jewlery is an online store selling exquisite handmade artisan jewellery and       accessories.
        Lynea is a university graduate with a lot of passion for fine arts. Her work with jewlery started when she
        developed a passion for imbedding traditional and exotic patterns into wearable pieces. This drove her to create
        her own specially designed handmade jewlery items. She took this further by enrolling in a special one-on-one
        jewlery-making course with a world-leading jewlery-maker in France.

        Her passion for arts did not stop there. Lynea took an interest in creating wire and gemstone jewelery and
        accessories using fine quality gemstones, crystals and beads. She also makes accessories, like bookmarks,
        keyrings and eyeglass chains.

        Lyneaâ€™s artistic work landed her many national TV, magazine and newspaper interviews. She has actively
        participated in many local fairs and exhibitions presenting her artistic work alongside her retail/consumer
        candle and other products.
